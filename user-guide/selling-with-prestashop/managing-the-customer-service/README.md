In PrestaShop 1.7, the Customer Service sections get a dedicated menu to give it the importance it deserves. Handling customer service is key to your success, so these pages make it possible for you to easily follow up on your customer's support requests and merchandise returns. 

This chapter contains the following sections:

* [Customer Service](customer-service.md)
* [Order Messages](order-messages.md)
* [Merchandise Returns](merchandise-returns.md)
