# Uninstalling PrestaShop

## Uninstalling PrestaShop <a id="UninstallingPrestaShop-UninstallingPrestaShop"></a>

PrestaShop is very easy to uninstall:

1. Delete all of PrestaShop's files and folders on your webserver, using your FTP client.
2. Delete all the `ps_` tables from PrestaShop's database, using phpMyAdmin.

You will lose all information registered to your store: customers, orders, invoices, products, etc.  
This cannot be undone, unless you have proper backups of all your data.
