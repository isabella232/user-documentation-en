## About the user documentation

Here is the repository where you will find the documentation on how to create, maintain, and make the most of a PrestaShop online store. 

It hosts the 1.7 documentation on how to install PrestaShop and use each page of the back office, available in 6 languages: Dutch, English, French, Italian, Persian, and Spanish.

This repository is synchronized with GitBook, a tool that allows creating modern and intuitive documentation pages. You can find the PrestaShop user documentation here: https://app.gitbook.com/@prestashop/space. Consequently, both interfaces (GitBook and GitHub) are open to contributions.

By saying that this repository is synchronized with GitBookâ€™s documentation, it means that edited contents are updated in real-time in GitHub and GitBook. If you change the content of any page on GitBook, your edits will be pushed to this repository. Conversely, commits pushed to this repository are imported on GitBook. 


## Contribution

Anyone is welcome to come by and contribute to translate, update, or write the 1.7 user documentation. Writing the user documentation requires using Git and GitHub, it works pretty much the same as a code contribution. Here are the instructions to follow:


### If you want to work using GitHub and edit a file

1. Create your GitHub account, if you do not have one already.
2. Browse to the target file.
3. Click the "Edit" button, make your changes in the editor, then click on "Propose file change". GitHub will automatically create a new fork and branch on your own GitHub account, then suggest a pull request to this repository.
4. Once the pull request is submitted, just wait for a product manager to come back to you.


### If you feel comfortable working with Git and forking the project

1. Create your GitHub account, if you do not have one already.
2. Fork this repository to your Github account.
3. Clone your fork to your local machine.
4. Create a branch in your local clone for your changes.
5. Change the files in your branch.
6. Push the changed branch to your fork in your GitHub account.
7. Create a pull request for your changes. If you need help to make a pull request, read the GitHub help page about [creating pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
8. Wait for one of the product managers to either include your change in the codebase or comment on possible adjustments to its content.


### If you want to submit an issue using GitHub

This is a ticket-tracker for this user documentation repository and the best place to write a suggestion or request an improvement. For that, you will just need a GitHub account.

And that's it: you have contributed to this open source project! Congratulations!
